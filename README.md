JSON Bookmarks Viewer 
=========

View JSON formatted bookmarks in your browser. Just drag and drop the bookmarks file onto your browser window (javascript has to be enabled).

## Supported bookmarks format

### Firefox

Open the bookmarks manager (_Ctrl+Shift+B_), select _Import and Backup_ > _Backup ..._ and save the JSON file to the location you selected.

### Chromium

As far as I know, all Chromium based browsers store their JSON formatted bookmarks in a file called _Bookmarks_ located in the user's profile directory (tested with the portable installations of Chrome, Opera and Vivaldi). I couldn't find any option to export the bookmarks from the browser, so you'll have to manually look for the file.
